Choice: I seek guidance and structured support systems to manage stress (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: Research shows ADMU provides structured support (cura personalis) while UP demands independent "sink or swim" survival. UST emphasizes high-volume endurance with rigid schedules. DLSU's trimestral system forces rapid time management and efficiency.

Question 2: How important is it for you to have strong mental health support services available?
Choice: Extremely important - I need accessible counseling and wellness resources (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: Important but I can manage mostly on my own (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Not a priority - I rely on friends and personal resilience (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU leads in mental health support with comprehensive services. UP and UST have severely understaffed services (10-12 week wait times reported). DLSU offers moderate support. UP and UST students bond through "trauma" rather than institutional care.

Question 3: Your ideal learning environment includes:
Choice: Oral exams and discussions where I defend my ideas verbally (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 2)

Choice: Accept it as part of the system and adapt independently (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UST normalizes "terror prof" culture as part of its rigorous training. ADMU emphasizes caring mentorship (cura personalis). UP students expect minimal teaching support. DLSU students prefer efficient, clear instruction over intimidation.

Question 6: How comfortable are you with a socially elite or wealthy student environment?

Choice: Doesn't matter much - I may not join organizations (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP has the most intense "apps" processes (psychological pressure, hazing-like elements reported). UST and DLSU also have competitive org applications. ADMU's org culture is professional but less brutal. Students avoiding intense org culture should avoid UP.

Choice: I prefer business casual but not mandatory uniforms (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST is the ONLY Big 4 university with mandatory uniforms and strict hair color policies. All other universities allow freedom of dress. UP is most liberal (absolute freedom), ADMU/DLSU have minimal codes (SOM business attire only).

Choice: Not important - I focus on academics (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and UST have the most beautiful, tree-filled campuses serving as "sanctuaries." UP's campus is loved for nature despite crumbling facilities. DLSU is vertical/urban with focus on modern facilities over aesthetic beauty.

Choice: Modern cafes and trendy restaurants (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST and UP have the best budget food culture (Dapitan, Area 2). ADMU's food is expensive (₱150-300) with some budget options requiring treks. DLSU has good food courts but higher prices. The University Belt offers unmatched affordability.

Question 16: How do you handle being part of a large, anonymous student population?
Choice: I thrive - I like independence and anonymity (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: I prefer smaller, tighter-knit communities (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: Size doesn't matter as long as I find my group (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP is largest with most anonymity. UST is large but block system creates tight bonds. ADMU is smallest with more personalized attention. DLSU balances size with efficiency. UP's scale can feel isolating without org support.

Choice: Graduating on time is essential to me (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: I'm okay with delays if it means better learning (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: Delays would cause significant stress (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP normalizes delays due to CRS and academic difficulty (being "delayed" is destigmatized). DLSU's trimester structure allows for catch-up. UST has debarment risks but summer terms help. ADMU has good retention support. UP students view delays as badges of survival.

Choice: That's exactly the social life I want (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Occasional participation is fine (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: Not my scene - I prefer other activities (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 4)

Choice: Can adapt but prefer some guidance (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP explicitly does not "spoon-feed" - professors facilitate rather than teach. ADMU provides structured guidance. DLSU offers clear, efficient instruction. UST has traditional lecture-based teaching. Students who need structure should avoid UP.

Choice: I support causes but don't actively participate (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU activism is critiqued as "performative" (Twitter threads, campus rallies). UP has genuine grassroots militant activism. DLSU is pragmatic and issue-based (tuition protests). UST activism is suppressed. UP students face real risks (red-tagging).

Question 28: How important is it to graduate from a program with high board exam passing rates?
Choice: Very important - that's a major decision factor (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 5)
Choice: Somewhat important but not the only factor (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Not important - I value other aspects of education (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
