Question 1: When facing a heavy academic workload, how do you typically respond?
Choice: I push through with intense study sessions and accept the pressure as necessary for excellence (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: I prioritize efficiency and time management, moving quickly through tasks (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: I struggle and adapt independently, seeking minimal help from professors (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I seek guidance and structured support systems to manage stress (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: Research shows ADMU provides structured support (cura personalis) while UP demands independent "sink or swim" survival. UST emphasizes high-volume endurance with rigid schedules. DLSU's trimestral system forces rapid time management and efficiency.


Question 5: When dealing with "terror professors" or harsh teaching styles, you:
Choice: View it as character-building and necessary for excellence (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Find it demotivating and prefer supportive, accessible professors (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: Accept it as part of the system and adapt independently (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UST normalizes "terror prof" culture as part of its rigorous training. ADMU emphasizes caring mentorship (cura personalis). UP students expect minimal teaching support. DLSU students prefer efficient, clear instruction over intimidation.


Question 14: When facing administrative bureaucracy or inefficiency, you:
Choice: Get frustrated and demand accountability (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Accept it and work around the system (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: Expect efficient, responsive administration (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 0)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and DLSU have relatively efficient administrations. UP and UST students report severe administrative dysfunction (CRS failures, OSA repression). UP and UST students develop "diskarte" to survive broken systems.


Question 21: How do you view academic competition among classmates?
Choice: Healthy competition motivates me (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: I prefer collaborative, supportive learning (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Competition is cutthroat - everyone for themselves (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UST's debarment culture creates most cutthroat competition. ADMU balances competition with support. DLSU has professional competition. UP's difficulty creates both competition and solidarity. UST's AMV and Pharmacy are described as "Hunger Games."

Question 22: Your comfort level with flooding and weather-related disruptions:
Choice: I can handle it - it's part of the experience (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer minimal weather disruptions (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 1)
Choice: I need reliable suspension announcements (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UST is legendary for flooding ("Waterworld"), creating trauma-bonding experiences. ADMU's Katipunan area floods biblically but campus has good drainage. UP and DLSU have moderate flooding issues. UST students embrace flood culture as identity marker.



Question 24: Your relationship with tradition and institutional history:
Choice: I deeply value tradition and legacy (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I'm indifferent to tradition (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 1)
Choice: I question tradition and prefer innovation (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST has strongest traditional Catholic identity (oldest university in Asia). ADMU balances Jesuit tradition with progressive thought. UP is defined by critical questioning of all traditions. DLSU is most modern/corporate. UST students love history but often clash with outdated policies.


Question 28: How important is it to graduate from a program with high board exam passing rates?
Choice: Very important - that's a major decision factor (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 5)
Choice: Somewhat important but not the only factor (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Not important - I value other aspects of education (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UST is a "board exam factory" with consistently high passing rates and topnotchers (especially Pharmacy, Accountancy). ADMU and DLSU have good rates. UP values critical thinking over test-taking. UST's curriculum is laser-focused on licensure exams.

Question 29: Your ideal campus would be described as:
Choice: A sanctuary - beautiful, peaceful, green (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Urban and modern - efficient and connected (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Gritty and real - reflects actual Filipino life (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and UST have most beautiful traditional campuses (trees, open spaces). DLSU is vertical/urban with focus on facilities. UP is vast but crumbling with "beautiful decay." ADMU and UST serve as psychological refuges; UP confronts students with reality.
