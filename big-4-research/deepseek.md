Question 1: How do you prefer to be assessed in your major subjects?
Choice: Primarily through high-stakes exams that test memorization and endurance (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: Through a mix of presentations, group projects, and articulated oral defenses (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: Through independent research papers and critical analysis with minimal guidance (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Through a relentless pace of quizzes, machine problems, and practical outputs every few weeks (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: Research shows UST emphasizes volume-heavy, exam-oriented assessment, especially in programs like AMV. ADMU is defined by oral exams (orals) and articulation. UP focuses on independent, critical deconstruction. DLSU's trimestral pace means constant, fast-paced outputs like machine problems in CCS/GCOE.



Question 3: When facing an overwhelming academic workload, you are most likely to:
Choice: Seek formal support from university counseling or guidance services (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: Bond with your block or classmates over the shared suffering, creating inside jokes (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Prioritize ruthlessly ("min-max"), drop low-impact tasks, and focus on surviving the term (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: See it as a systemic failure and potentially channel frustration into political discourse or protest (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU leads in institutional mental health support. UST's "trauma bonding" is a key social cohesion mechanism. DLSU's trimestral pace necessitates pragmatic "survival of the fittest" triage. UP's culture often frames struggle as a systemic issue leading to activism.

Question 4: How important is it for you to have a beautiful, green, and peaceful physical campus?
Choice: Extremely important; it's a necessary sanctuary for my mental well-being (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Choice: Somewhat important, but I value state-of-the-art indoor facilities (like libraries and labs) more (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Not a priority; I can handle a decaying or chaotic environment if the intellectual freedom is strong (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Very important, especially if it includes historic architecture and serves as a proud symbol (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 1, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU's lush "green flag" campus is consistently cited for mental health. DLSU's Henry Sy Sr. Hall represents premium facilities. UP students often tolerate "beautiful ruins" for the sake of freedom. UST's Main Building and Arch are central to its identity and lore.



Question 6: How do you feel about mandatory uniforms or strict dress codes in college?
Choice: I prefer it; it reduces daily stress and acts as a social equalizer (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: I'm against it; absolute freedom of expression is non-negotiable for me (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I'm okay with a basic "don't look sloppy" rule for specific contexts, but generally want freedom (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I don't mind as long as it doesn't extend to policing hair color or personal style (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Scoring Rationale: UST is the only Big 4 with mandatory uniforms, seen as a "great equalizer." UP has no dress code, championing freedom. DLSU and ADMU have business-casual expectations in certain colleges (e.g., SOM) but are generally liberal, with ADMU specifically noted for allowing wild hair colors.





Question 9: How do you view the relationship between your faith/spirituality and your education?
Choice: I value being in a secular environment where religious doctrine is separate from academics and campus life (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I appreciate critical engagement with theology and philosophy, even if it challenges my beliefs (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: I prefer a traditional, values-based Catholic education that integrates faith into campus rituals (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: I am indifferent; I'll adapt to the environment as long as it's not forcefully imposed (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP is the only secular institution. ADMU uses Theology/Philo to critically deconstruct faith. UST maintains traditional Catholic integration. DLSU, while Catholic, is described as more pragmatic and less theologically intense, with students often adapting.

Question 10: What is your tolerance for administrative bureaucracy and institutional friction?
Choice: Very low: I expect efficient, customer-service-oriented systems (online portals, clear processes) (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: High: I accept that struggling with a slow, frustrating system (for enrollment, etc.) is part of the character-building experience (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: Moderate, but I strongly resent arbitrary, repressive rules that police student expression or appearance (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I can handle it if the academic results (e.g., board exam performance) are worth the hassle (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU is praised for administrative efficiency. UP's CRS "enlistment hell" is a defining, accepted trauma. UP also conflicts with admin over commercialization. UST students endure bureaucratic repression (OSA) for the sake of the university's credentialing value.

Question 11: How likely are you to participate in a protest or rally during your time in university?
Choice: Very Likely - it's an integral part of the education and a duty (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Likely - but mainly for issues directly affecting students (like tuition hikes) (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Choice: Neutral - I might attend if my friends go or if it's a big campus event (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: Unlikely - I prefer other channels for advocacy or change (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: Very Unlikely - I want to avoid political involvement on campus (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UP has a dominant "Tibak" culture. DLSU mobilizes reliably for tuition protests (#AyokongMagMahal). ADMU activism is more moderate/"polite dissent." UST's climate is suppressed, with activism often framed within Catholic social teachings or focused on internal rights.

Question 12: What is your primary expectation for career preparation during university?
Choice: A strong, well-connected alumni network in business and corporate fields (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Developing unparalleled critical thinking and analytical skills, valued in diverse fields (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Gaining technical, hands-on competence and discipline that ensures high employability and board exam success (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Building a resume full of leadership roles in professional student organizations (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and DLSU are feeders for corporate elite. UP's brand is critical thinking. UST is a "board exam factory" producing technically competent graduates. DLSU and ADMU orgs are explicitly resume-driven.



Question 14: How do you plan to handle the daily commute to and around campus?
Choice: I'll drive or be fetched by car, dealing with traffic but having a private space (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: I'll live in a condo or dorm very close by, minimizing travel time but at a higher cost (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: I'll master the multi-modal commute (jeepney/LRT/trike/walking) as a badge of honor and necessity (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: I'll rely on (and sometimes battle for) internal campus shuttles or elevators (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU has a strong "car culture." DLSU has a distinct "condo culture" and infamous "elevator wars." UP and UST are defined by jeepney commutes (Ikot/TOKI for UP, flooding for UST). DLSU's elevator stress is a unique daily trauma.





Question 17: How do you feel about your university being in a "bubble" somewhat insulated from the realities of the surrounding city?
Choice: I prefer it; campus should be a safe, contemplative sanctuary (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 4)
Choice: I'm against it; campus should be integrated with the city, reflecting its chaos and energy (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: It's inevitable but should be consciously challenged through outreach programs and critical discourse (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: The bubble is porous; daily commutes and surrounding dangers keep us grounded (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU's "Katipunan Bubble" is both cherished and critiqued. DLSU's Taft location makes its "Green Bubble" permeable to urban grit. UP's open campus is integrated but also has safety issues. UST's beautiful campus is a "golden cage" within chaotic Manila.

Question 18: What is your preferred study environment during crunch time?
Choice: In a world-class, air-conditioned library open 24/7 (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Outdoors on the grass, under trees, or in open-air pavilions (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: In a dorm room or condo, pulling all-nighters with blockmates or suitemates (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: In a crowded, noisy cafeteria or tambayan, fueled by cheap coffee and camaraderie (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU's Henry Sy Sr. Hall is iconic. ADMU and UP have beloved green spaces. DLSU's condo culture and UST's block system foster group all-nighters. UP's Area 2 and UST's Dapitan are hubs for communal, budget studying.

Question 19: How would you describe your approach to time and deadlines?
Choice: Structured Planner: I thrive on clear syllabi, consistent pacing, and meeting incremental deadlines (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: Sprint Specialist: I excel under intense, short-term pressure and can manage a relentless pace of deliverables (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Independent Navigator: I work best when I set my own pace, even if it means defying traditional deadlines or being "delayed" (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Endurance Grinder: I can handle a massive, constant volume of work through sheer stamina and routine (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU provides structured guidance. DLSU's trimestral system is a "sprint." UP normalizes being "delayed" and values self-directed pacing. UST's volume-heavy "7-to-7" schedule requires endurance.



Question 21: When forming friend groups, what factor is most influential to you?
Choice: Shared high school background or "dynastic" alumni networks (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: Shared college or academic program, leading to "block" or "course" bonding (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Shared political beliefs or level of activism (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Shared interests through organizations, regardless of course or background (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU has noted cliques based on elite high school lineage. UST's block system is foundational for friendship. UP's social circles are heavily influenced by political alignment. DLSU's org-centric and inclusive "chill" culture facilitates interest-based groups.




Question 24: You're assigned a group project with randomly selected classmates. What is your biggest worry?
Choice: Groupmates from a management/business background being overly transactional and capitalistic in approach (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: Groupmates from humanities/arts backgrounds being impractical idealists (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 1)
Choice: Freeloaders who won't contribute, forcing me to carry the workload (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: My grade being dependent on others in a high-stakes, volume-heavy system (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU research highlights the SOM vs. SOH/SOSS dichotomy in group work. DLSU and UP narratives frequently complain about freeloaders. UST's volume-heavy system where blocks succeed or fail together makes group dependency a major stressor.

Question 25: How do you view school spirit and wearing university merchandise?
Choice: I'll proudly wear it; I love representing my school and its values (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I'll wear it, but often with a sense of irony or mixed feelings due to the university's flaws (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I might wear it for specific events but generally don't feel a strong need to display school affiliation (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: I'm critical of blind school spirit; my loyalty is to my peers, not the institution (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST's Paskuhan and uniform culture foster strong school pride. UP students have a famously complicated love-hate relationship with their university. DLSU's "chill" vibe might make merch less of an identity marker. UP's adversarial relationship with its admin fuels critical loyalty.



Question 27: How do you handle strict, non-academic rules (e.g., hair color, curfews, guest policies)?
Choice: I generally follow them; rules provide necessary order and safety (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: I follow them but find them annoying and overly restrictive (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 4)
Choice: I question them and will challenge or protest rules I find unreasonable (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I find creative ways to work around them without direct confrontation (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UST's culture, enforced by OSA, expects compliance. UP's culture encourages challenging authority. ADMU and DLSU students, while in more rule-bound environments than UP, are noted for their "diskarte" and adaptability in navigating systems.

Question 28: What kind of relationship do you expect to have with your professors?
Choice: Formal and respectful, with clear boundaries; they are primarily evaluators (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Accessible mentors: I should be able to consult them during office hours for guidance (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Intellectual facilitators: They provoke thought but expect me to find answers independently (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: A mix: some will be "terror" figures to be avoided, others will be inspiring guides (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UST's traditional, volume-heavy model can create distance. ADMU's *cura personalis* encourages mentorship. UP's "sink or swim" model positions professors as facilitators. All campuses have a mix of "terror" and "green flag" profs, a universally recognized dichotomy.

Question 29: What does "success" in your university life look like to you?
Choice: Graduating with Latin honors and a high GPA (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Building a powerful network and resume through orgs and internships (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Developing a sharp, critical political consciousness and contributing to advocacy (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Simply surviving and graduating on time, given the system's difficulty (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and UST have grade-focused cultures (QPI anxiety, board exam focus). ADMU and DLSU are career-network oriented. UP success is often defined by political awakening. DLSU's trimestral pace and UST's volume make timely survival a key success metric.
