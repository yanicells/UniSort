Question 1: How do you handle a high-pressure academic environment?
Choice: I prefer a fast-paced "sprint" where I just need to survive 14 weeks at a time, even if it means no sleep. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: I can handle a massive volume of work and long hours (7am-7pm), relying on endurance and shared suffering with classmates. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer deep, philosophical reflection and structured guidance, even if it involves intense oral defense. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: I thrive in a "sink or swim" environment where I have to teach myself the material because the professor might not. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU’s trimestral system is described as a "sprint" and "min-maxing" effort. UST is defined by "volume over depth" and 12-hour schedules. ADMU emphasizes "guided rigor" and oral expression. UP is famously "sink or swim" with a culture of independent survival.

Question 9: Choose a "Red Flag" you are willing to tolerate:
Choice: A "Hunger Games" style enrollment system where I might not get classes and get delayed. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: A repressive administration that censors student media and polices morals. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: A social bubble where people can be out-of-touch with the reality of poverty. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: A "burnout" pace where I have no breaks between terms. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: These correspond to the major complaints in the research: UP's enlistment, UST's OSA, ADMU's elitist bubble, and DLSU's trimestral fatigue.

Question 11: How do you handle failure or being "delayed"?
Choice: It's a badge of honor. Everyone gets delayed; it just means I survived the rigor. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: It's a major fear. I am terrified of "debarment" (being kicked out) if I fail too many units. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: It happens, but the system (trimestral/QPI) pushes me to catch up or shift quickly. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP destigmatizes delay (MRR). UST and ADMU (QPI) have strict retention rules where failure leads to expulsion/debarment. DLSU's trimestral system allows fast retakes.

Question 12: Which social scenario sounds most appealing?
Choice: "Happy Thursday"—drinking and partying weekly as a release from stress. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: "Paskuhan"—waiting all year for a massive, school-wide Christmas festival payoff. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: "Chill Drinking/Walwal"—casual drinking at affordable spots or intellectual discussions over beer. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: "Rest"—I am too tired from academics to have a chaotic social life. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: "Happy Thursday" is iconic to DLSU. "Paskuhan" is UST's defining event. UP culture is "walwal" but often low-budget. ADMU is more low-key or home-party oriented.


Question 16: What is your attitude toward "Terror Profs"?
Choice: I avoid them at all costs to protect my mental health. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: I tolerate them because they are often "legendary" or gatekeepers of quality. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I feel powerless against them because the department protects them. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: "Terror profs" are a fixture in UP and UST (Engineering/Pharmacy). ADMU and DLSU students are more likely to avoid them or rate them poorly, though they exist. UST narratives highlight feeling "powerless."


Question 22: How do you handle "Group Work"?
Choice: I treat it like a business project—efficient, delegated, professional. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: It's a struggle because people flake, but we bond over the stress. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer working alone; group work is inefficient. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU/ADMU (SOM) emphasize corporate-style group work. UP values independence. UST bonds through shared struggle in blocks.

Question 23: What is your take on "Hazings" or intense Org application processes?
Choice: Hard pass. I won't debase myself for an organization. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Choice: It's part of the culture/tradition to prove commitment ("kupal culture"). (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: I'll do it if it guarantees me connections and exam tips. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP has a documented history of "Kupal culture" and intense apps (hazing-lite). ADMU/DLSU have strict anti-hazing stances, though some exclusivity exists.


Question 29: Post-Graduation Goal?
Choice: Top the Board Exams. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Corporate Executive/Business Owner. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Public Service/NGO/Law/Academe. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Medical Field. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UST and UP are "Board Exam" powerhouses. DLSU is the corporate forge. ADMU excels in law/humanities/service. UST/UP are top choices for Med.
