Question 1: How do you handle a high-pressure academic environment?
Choice: I prefer a fast-paced "sprint" where I just need to survive 14 weeks at a time, even if it means no sleep. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: I can handle a massive volume of work and long hours (7am-7pm), relying on endurance and shared suffering with classmates. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer deep, philosophical reflection and structured guidance, even if it involves intense oral defense. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: I thrive in a "sink or swim" environment where I have to teach myself the material because the professor might not. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU’s trimestral system is described as a "sprint" and "min-maxing" effort. UST is defined by "volume over depth" and 12-hour schedules. ADMU emphasizes "guided rigor" and oral expression. UP is famously "sink or swim" with a culture of independent survival.

Question 2: How important is "Freedom of Expression" regarding your appearance (hair color, clothes) on campus?
Choice: Non-negotiable. I need absolute freedom to wear what I want and express my identity. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I don't mind a dress code or uniform; it actually saves me the stress of choosing outfits. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer looking polished or "corporate ready," so a smart casual vibe or dress code is fine. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: UP has no dress code and high expression freedom. UST is the only Big 4 with a strict uniform and hair policies. DLSU and ADMU have dress codes but are generally more relaxed than UST, though DLSU leans towards a "corporate/polished" look.

Question 3: Which campus vibe makes you feel most at peace?
Choice: A "Sanctuary" or "Garden" feel—lots of trees, open fields, and distinct separation from the city noise. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: A "Vertical Campus"—modern buildings, elevators, and air-conditioning to escape the city heat. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 1)
Choice: A "Historical/Homey" feel—walking under old arches, but accepting that flooding is part of the lore. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 2, UST: 5)
Choice: A "Public Park" feel—open to the public, vast walking distances, nature mixed with some crumbling infrastructure. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is described as a "green bubble." DLSU is a vertical campus in a concrete jungle. UST is defined by history and flood culture. UP is an open campus with a "beautiful ruins" aesthetic and nature.

Question 4: How do you react to "Conyo" speech (Taglish with a specific accent)?
Choice: It's my natural way of speaking; I feel right at home. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I can code-switch into it when needed, but I prefer "kanal" or grounded humor. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I find it alienating or annoying; I prefer an environment where wealth isn't signaled through language. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: Research highlights ADMU and DLSU as centers of "Conyo" culture. UST prides itself on being "kanal" and relatable. UP views "Conyo" as a marker of the "Burgis" invasion and often views it negatively.

Question 5: What is your stance on Theology or Religion in your education?
Choice: I want a secular education. No mandatory mass, no theology classes. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I value a critical, philosophical approach to faith—questioning everything, even the church itself. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: I appreciate traditional Catholic structures, rituals, and a conservative environment. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UP is the only secular institution. ADMU (Jesuit) focuses on critical theology and questioning. UST (Dominican) is traditional and conservative. DLSU (La Salle) is Catholic but pragmatic.

Question 6: How much "hand-holding" or administrative support do you expect?
Choice: I expect efficient systems. If I pay high tuition, I want aircon, working websites, and clear processes. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Choice: I expect to be cared for as a person (*cura personalis*), with accessible mental health support and guidance. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I expect nothing. I am ready to fight for my class slots, camp out for forms, and navigate a broken system. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP's "CRS" and admin are notoriously difficult/broken. DLSU is viewed as "getting what you pay for" in efficiency. ADMU emphasizes *cura personalis* (care). UST's admin is often viewed as repressive or bureaucratic.

Question 7: What is your ideal daily food budget and vibe?
Choice: Budget is tight (P50-P90). I want delicious, cheap, no-frills street food or simple canteens. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Mid-range (P150-P200). I like food courts and fast food chains. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Premium (P250+). I enjoy studying in aesthetic cafes and eating at restaurants regularly. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP (Area 2) and UST (Dapitan/Noval) are famous for cheap, good food culture. ADMU and DLSU surround areas (Katipunan/Taft) are expensive/gentrified, with "café culture" being dominant in ADMU.

Question 8: How do you view political activism?
Choice: It is essential. I want to be on the "frontlines" of national issues, even if it involves risk. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I prefer "radical moderation"—intellectual discussions and statements, but maybe less street protest. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: I am pragmatic. I care about issues but focus more on my career or institutional changes. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I feel suppressed. I want to speak out, but the administration might punish me. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UP is the center of militant activism. ADMU is "radical moderate/pink." DLSU is pragmatic/institutional. UST students are restive but suppressed by the OSA.

Question 9: Choose a "Red Flag" you are willing to tolerate:
Choice: A "Hunger Games" style enrollment system where I might not get classes and get delayed. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: A repressive administration that censors student media and polices morals. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: A social bubble where people can be out-of-touch with the reality of poverty. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: A "burnout" pace where I have no breaks between terms. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: These correspond to the major complaints in the research: UP's enlistment, UST's OSA, ADMU's elitist bubble, and DLSU's trimestral fatigue.

Question 10: What is your preferred schedule structure?
Choice: Block Section. I want to be with the same group of classmates for all subjects to build a "trauma bond." (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: Flexible/Independent. I want to choose my own schedule and classmates, even if it's lonely. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: Structured but not rigid. A mix of core blocks and electives. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST relies heavily on block sections which foster "trauma bonding." UP is highly individualistic/flexible. ADMU/DLSU are hybrids but lean towards structure.

Question 11: How do you handle failure or being "delayed"?
Choice: It's a badge of honor. Everyone gets delayed; it just means I survived the rigor. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: It's a major fear. I am terrified of "debarment" (being kicked out) if I fail too many units. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: It happens, but the system (trimestral/QPI) pushes me to catch up or shift quickly. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP destigmatizes delay (MRR). UST and ADMU (QPI) have strict retention rules where failure leads to expulsion/debarment. DLSU's trimestral system allows fast retakes.

Question 12: Which social scenario sounds most appealing?
Choice: "Happy Thursday"—drinking and partying weekly as a release from stress. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: "Paskuhan"—waiting all year for a massive, school-wide Christmas festival payoff. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: "Chill Drinking/Walwal"—casual drinking at affordable spots or intellectual discussions over beer. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: "Rest"—I am too tired from academics to have a chaotic social life. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: "Happy Thursday" is iconic to DLSU. "Paskuhan" is UST's defining event. UP culture is "walwal" but often low-budget. ADMU is more low-key or home-party oriented.

Question 13: How much do you value "School Pride" (UAAP, etc.)?
Choice: Immensely. I will fight online for my school and scream my lungs out at games. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Moderate. I'm proud, but I'm also critical of the institution's flaws. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: Low. I'm here for the degree, not the mascot. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: All Big 4 have pride, but UP's recent wins and UST's "defensive pride" (due to admin issues) are notable. ADMU/DLSU have a traditional rivalry. UST students defend the school against outsiders fiercely despite hating the admin.

Question 14: Which "Green Flag" matters most to you?
Choice: A community that is "down-to-earth," "kanal" (relatable), and warm. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: A culture of "efficiency," good facilities, and professional networking. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Choice: A focus on "holistic formation," philosophy, and caring for the person. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: Absolute "academic freedom" and the diversity of people you meet. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: Matches the core "Green Flags" identified in the research: UST's community/humility, DLSU's facilities/network, ADMU's formation, UP's freedom/diversity.

Question 15: How do you prefer to get around campus?
Choice: I don't mind walking long distances, even in the heat/sun. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: I need a "compact" campus or elevators; I hate sweating before class. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 3)
Choice: I rely on a car or campus shuttles because the campus is huge/gated. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP is a walking campus. DLSU is vertical (elevators). ADMU is a car/shuttle campus. UST is compact but requires walking/wading.

Question 16: What is your attitude toward "Terror Profs"?
Choice: I avoid them at all costs to protect my mental health. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: I tolerate them because they are often "legendary" or gatekeepers of quality. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I feel powerless against them because the department protects them. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: "Terror profs" are a fixture in UP and UST (Engineering/Pharmacy). ADMU and DLSU students are more likely to avoid them or rate them poorly, though they exist. UST narratives highlight feeling "powerless."

Question 17: How do you view LGBTQ+ inclusivity on campus?
Choice: I need a campus that is loud, proud, and institutionally supportive (Gender Hubs, etc.). (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Choice: I am fine with a "tolerant" student body, even if the admin is conservative. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: I want a space where expression is totally normalized and non-conformity is the norm. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP and ADMU are the most inclusive (ADMU has Gender Hub). UST is "tolerant" among students but repressive institutionally. DLSU is generally inclusive but less vocal/structured than ADMU.

Question 18: What is your primary motivation for joining a Student Org?
Choice: Corporate training. I want to build a resume for a multinational company. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: Political advocacy. I want to change society. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Socializing/Bonding. I want to find friends and have fun. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Networking/Survival. I need access to "old exams" and tips to pass. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU/ADMU orgs are "corporate simulations." UP orgs are political or survival-based (old exams). UST orgs are social but bureaucratically stifled.

Question 19: How "Street Smart" are you?
Choice: Very. I can navigate jeeps, floods, and snatchers without fear. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Moderate. I can commute but prefer safe zones. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Low. I've lived a sheltered life ("hatid-sundo") and might experience culture shock. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP and UST require high street smarts (commuting, safety risks). ADMU is a "bubble" where students are often sheltered. DLSU is in a rough area (Taft) but students often stay in condos/safe zones.

Question 20: How do you feel about mandatory Philosophy and Theology classes for ALL majors?
Choice: I love it. It makes me a well-rounded person. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 0, UST: 3)
Choice: It's okay, as long as it's not too heavy. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Choice: Hate it. I just want to study my major. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is famous for its heavy Core Curriculum (Philo/Theo). UST also requires it. UP focuses on GE but not religious theology. DLSU has them but they are less central than in ADMU.

Question 21: Which "Stereotype" do you identify with most?
Choice: The "Articulate Leader" who questions authority. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Choice: The "Corporate Go-Getter" who works hard and plays hard. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: The "Resilient Survivor" who can endure anything. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: Matches the sociological archetypes in the research: ADMU (Thinker/Leader), DLSU (Achiever/Corporate), UP/UST (Survivor/Grit).

Question 22: How do you handle "Group Work"?
Choice: I treat it like a business project—efficient, delegated, professional. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: It's a struggle because people flake, but we bond over the stress. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer working alone; group work is inefficient. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU/ADMU (SOM) emphasize corporate-style group work. UP values independence. UST bonds through shared struggle in blocks.

Question 23: What is your take on "Hazings" or intense Org application processes?
Choice: Hard pass. I won't debase myself for an organization. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Choice: It's part of the culture/tradition to prove commitment ("kupal culture"). (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: I'll do it if it guarantees me connections and exam tips. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP has a documented history of "Kupal culture" and intense apps (hazing-lite). ADMU/DLSU have strict anti-hazing stances, though some exclusivity exists.

Question 24: How much do you care about the campus "Aesthetics"?
Choice: I want a "Green Flag" campus—Instagrammable, clean, and stress-reducing. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: I don't care about looks, I care about history and character. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Function over form. As long as the wifi works, I'm good. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and DLSU (Henry Sy) are praised for facilities. UP and UST are loved for character/history but criticized for maintenance/decay.

Question 25: Dealing with "The Flood":
Choice: Deal breaker. I cannot study somewhere that floods waist-deep. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 0)
Choice: It's an adventure. I'm willing to wade or ride a boat if needed. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: I'll just live in a high-rise condo nearby to avoid it. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST is legendary for flooding (Waterworld). DLSU (Taft) floods but has condo culture. ADMU/UP are generally safer from flood disruption (ADMU is on a hill, UP is vast).

Question 26: What’s your preferred crowd?
Choice: A mix of social classes—from wealthy to working class. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Mostly middle-to-upper class. I feel more comfortable with people who have similar lifestyles. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: Intellectuals and artists, regardless of background. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP and UST are more socioeconomically diverse. ADMU and DLSU are perceived as (and statistically are) more wealthy/middle-upper class, though they have scholars.

Question 27: How do you approach "Oral Recitation/Exams"?
Choice: I thrive on it. I love debating and articulating my thoughts on the spot. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 1)
Choice: I dread it. I prefer written exams or problem sets. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: I can do it if I prepared a script, but I hate improvisation. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU's culture heavily emphasizes oral exams (Philo/Theo). UST and UP (Science/Engg) focus more on written/traditional assessments.

Question 28: What is your view on "Grade Inflation" (getting high grades)?
Choice: High grades should be rare. If everyone is Cum Laude, it means nothing. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: High grades are a sign of a supportive system, not "easy" schooling. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Choice: I don't care about Latin Honors, I just want to graduate. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UST (especially AMV/Science) is known for grade deflation/zero-based grading. UP and ADMU have recent debates about "inflation" (lots of Laudes), which students defend as better pedagogy.

Question 29: Post-Graduation Goal?
Choice: Top the Board Exams. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Corporate Executive/Business Owner. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Public Service/NGO/Law/Academe. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Medical Field. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UST and UP are "Board Exam" powerhouses. DLSU is the corporate forge. ADMU excels in law/humanities/service. UST/UP are top choices for Med.

Question 30: Finally, how do you handle "The Bubble"?
Choice: I prefer staying in a comfortable, safe bubble. Reality is stressful enough. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I want to burst the bubble. I want to be exposed to the gritty reality of the Philippines daily. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: I want a bubble I can retreat to, but with easy access to the city. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is the ultimate "Bubble." UP and UST force exposure to reality (poverty, commute, grit). DLSU is a bubble inside a gritty area (Taft).
