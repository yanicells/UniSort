Question 2: How important is "Freedom of Expression" regarding your appearance (hair color, clothes) on campus?
Choice: Non-negotiable. I need absolute freedom to wear what I want and express my identity. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I don't mind a dress code or uniform; it actually saves me the stress of choosing outfits. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer looking polished or "corporate ready," so a smart casual vibe or dress code is fine. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: UP has no dress code and high expression freedom. UST is the only Big 4 with a strict uniform and hair policies. DLSU and ADMU have dress codes but are generally more relaxed than UST, though DLSU leans towards a "corporate/polished" look.

Question 3: Which campus vibe makes you feel most at peace?
Choice: A "Sanctuary" or "Garden" feel—lots of trees, open fields, and distinct separation from the city noise. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: A "Vertical Campus"—modern buildings, elevators, and air-conditioning to escape the city heat. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 1)
Choice: A "Historical/Homey" feel—walking under old arches, but accepting that flooding is part of the lore. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 2, UST: 5)
Choice: A "Public Park" feel—open to the public, vast walking distances, nature mixed with some crumbling infrastructure. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is described as a "green bubble." DLSU is a vertical campus in a concrete jungle. UST is defined by history and flood culture. UP is an open campus with a "beautiful ruins" aesthetic and nature.

Question 4: How do you react to "Conyo" speech (Taglish with a specific accent)?
Choice: It's my natural way of speaking; I feel right at home. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I can code-switch into it when needed, but I prefer "kanal" or grounded humor. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: I find it alienating or annoying; I prefer an environment where wealth isn't signaled through language. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: Research highlights ADMU and DLSU as centers of "Conyo" culture. UST prides itself on being "kanal" and relatable. UP views "Conyo" as a marker of the "Burgis" invasion and often views it negatively.

Question 5: What is your stance on Theology or Religion in your education?
Choice: I want a secular education. No mandatory mass, no theology classes. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I value a critical, philosophical approach to faith—questioning everything, even the church itself. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: I appreciate traditional Catholic structures, rituals, and a conservative environment. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UP is the only secular institution. ADMU (Jesuit) focuses on critical theology and questioning. UST (Dominican) is traditional and conservative. DLSU (La Salle) is Catholic but pragmatic.

Question 6: How much "hand-holding" or administrative support do you expect?
Choice: I expect efficient systems. If I pay high tuition, I want aircon, working websites, and clear processes. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Choice: I expect to be cared for as a person (*cura personalis*), with accessible mental health support and guidance. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I expect nothing. I am ready to fight for my class slots, camp out for forms, and navigate a broken system. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP's "CRS" and admin are notoriously difficult/broken. DLSU is viewed as "getting what you pay for" in efficiency. ADMU emphasizes *cura personalis* (care). UST's admin is often viewed as repressive or bureaucratic.

Question 7: What is your ideal daily food budget and vibe?
Choice: Budget is tight (P50-P90). I want delicious, cheap, no-frills street food or simple canteens. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Mid-range (P150-P200). I like food courts and fast food chains. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Premium (P250+). I enjoy studying in aesthetic cafes and eating at restaurants regularly. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP (Area 2) and UST (Dapitan/Noval) are famous for cheap, good food culture. ADMU and DLSU surround areas (Katipunan/Taft) are expensive/gentrified, with "café culture" being dominant in ADMU.

Question 8: How do you view political activism?
Choice: It is essential. I want to be on the "frontlines" of national issues, even if it involves risk. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: I prefer "radical moderation"—intellectual discussions and statements, but maybe less street protest. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: I am pragmatic. I care about issues but focus more on my career or institutional changes. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I feel suppressed. I want to speak out, but the administration might punish me. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: UP is the center of militant activism. ADMU is "radical moderate/pink." DLSU is pragmatic/institutional. UST students are restive but suppressed by the OSA.

Question 10: What is your preferred schedule structure?
Choice: Block Section. I want to be with the same group of classmates for all subjects to build a "trauma bond." (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: Flexible/Independent. I want to choose my own schedule and classmates, even if it's lonely. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: Structured but not rigid. A mix of core blocks and electives. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST relies heavily on block sections which foster "trauma bonding." UP is highly individualistic/flexible. ADMU/DLSU are hybrids but lean towards structure.

Question 13: How much do you value "School Pride" (UAAP, etc.)?
Choice: Immensely. I will fight online for my school and scream my lungs out at games. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Moderate. I'm proud, but I'm also critical of the institution's flaws. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: Low. I'm here for the degree, not the mascot. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: All Big 4 have pride, but UP's recent wins and UST's "defensive pride" (due to admin issues) are notable. ADMU/DLSU have a traditional rivalry. UST students defend the school against outsiders fiercely despite hating the admin.

Question 14: Which "Green Flag" matters most to you?
Choice: A community that is "down-to-earth," "kanal" (relatable), and warm. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: A culture of "efficiency," good facilities, and professional networking. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Choice: A focus on "holistic formation," philosophy, and caring for the person. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: Absolute "academic freedom" and the diversity of people you meet. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: Matches the core "Green Flags" identified in the research: UST's community/humility, DLSU's facilities/network, ADMU's formation, UP's freedom/diversity.

Question 15: How do you prefer to get around campus?
Choice: I don't mind walking long distances, even in the heat/sun. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: I need a "compact" campus or elevators; I hate sweating before class. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 3)
Choice: I rely on a car or campus shuttles because the campus is huge/gated. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP is a walking campus. DLSU is vertical (elevators). ADMU is a car/shuttle campus. UST is compact but requires walking/wading.

Question 17: How do you view LGBTQ+ inclusivity on campus?
Choice: I need a campus that is loud, proud, and institutionally supportive (Gender Hubs, etc.). (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Choice: I am fine with a "tolerant" student body, even if the admin is conservative. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: I want a space where expression is totally normalized and non-conformity is the norm. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP and ADMU are the most inclusive (ADMU has Gender Hub). UST is "tolerant" among students but repressive institutionally. DLSU is generally inclusive but less vocal/structured than ADMU.

Question 18: What is your primary motivation for joining a Student Org?
Choice: Corporate training. I want to build a resume for a multinational company. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: Political advocacy. I want to change society. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Socializing/Bonding. I want to find friends and have fun. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Networking/Survival. I need access to "old exams" and tips to pass. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU/ADMU orgs are "corporate simulations." UP orgs are political or survival-based (old exams). UST orgs are social but bureaucratically stifled.

Question 19: How "Street Smart" are you?
Choice: Very. I can navigate jeeps, floods, and snatchers without fear. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Moderate. I can commute but prefer safe zones. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Low. I've lived a sheltered life ("hatid-sundo") and might experience culture shock. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP and UST require high street smarts (commuting, safety risks). ADMU is a "bubble" where students are often sheltered. DLSU is in a rough area (Taft) but students often stay in condos/safe zones.

Question 20: How do you feel about mandatory Philosophy and Theology classes for ALL majors?
Choice: I love it. It makes me a well-rounded person. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 0, UST: 3)
Choice: It's okay, as long as it's not too heavy. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Choice: Hate it. I just want to study my major. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is famous for its heavy Core Curriculum (Philo/Theo). UST also requires it. UP focuses on GE but not religious theology. DLSU has them but they are less central than in ADMU.

Question 21: Which "Stereotype" do you identify with most?
Choice: The "Articulate Leader" who questions authority. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Choice: The "Corporate Go-Getter" who works hard and plays hard. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: The "Resilient Survivor" who can endure anything. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: Matches the sociological archetypes in the research: ADMU (Thinker/Leader), DLSU (Achiever/Corporate), UP/UST (Survivor/Grit).

Question 24: How much do you care about the campus "Aesthetics"?
Choice: I want a scenic, Instagrammable, clean, and stress-reducing campus. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: I don't care about looks, I care about history and character. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Function over form. As long as the wifi works, I'm good. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and DLSU (Henry Sy) are praised for facilities. UP and UST are loved for character/history but criticized for maintenance/decay.

Question 25: Dealing with "The Flood":
Choice: Deal breaker. I cannot study somewhere that floods waist-deep. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 0)
Choice: It's an adventure. I'm willing to wade or ride a boat if needed. (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: I'll just live in a high-rise condo nearby to avoid it. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST is legendary for flooding (Waterworld). DLSU (Taft) floods but has condo culture. ADMU/UP are generally safer from flood disruption (ADMU is on a hill, UP is vast).

Question 26: What’s your preferred crowd?
Choice: A mix of social classes—from wealthy to working class. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Mostly middle-to-upper class. I feel more comfortable with people who have similar lifestyles. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: Intellectuals and artists, regardless of background. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UP and UST are more socioeconomically diverse. ADMU and DLSU are perceived as (and statistically are) more wealthy/middle-upper class, though they have scholars.

Question 27: How do you approach "Oral Recitation/Exams"?
Choice: I thrive on it. I love debating and articulating my thoughts on the spot. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 1)
Choice: I dread it. I prefer written exams or problem sets. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: I can do it if I prepared a script, but I hate improvisation. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU's culture heavily emphasizes oral exams (Philo/Theo). UST and UP (Science/Engg) focus more on written/traditional assessments.

Question 28: What is your view on "Grade Inflation" (getting high grades)?
Choice: High grades should be rare. If everyone is Cum Laude, it means nothing. (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: High grades are a sign of a supportive system, not "easy" schooling. (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Choice: I don't care about Latin Honors, I just want to graduate. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UST (especially AMV/Science) is known for grade deflation/zero-based grading. UP and ADMU have recent debates about "inflation" (lots of Laudes), which students defend as better pedagogy.

Question 30: Finally, how do you handle "The Bubble"?
Choice: I prefer staying in a comfortable, safe bubble. Reality is stressful enough. (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: I want to burst the bubble. I want to be exposed to the gritty reality of the Philippines daily. (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: I want a bubble I can retreat to, but with easy access to the city. (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is the ultimate "Bubble." UP and UST force exposure to reality (poverty, commute, grit). DLSU is a bubble inside a gritty area (Taft).

Question 2: How important is it for you to have strong mental health support services available?
Choice: Extremely important - I need accessible counseling and wellness resources (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: Important but I can manage mostly on my own (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Not a priority - I rely on friends and personal resilience (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU leads in mental health support with comprehensive services. UP and UST have severely understaffed services (10-12 week wait times reported). DLSU offers moderate support. UP and UST students bond through "trauma" rather than institutional care.

Question 3: Your ideal learning environment includes:
Choice: Oral exams and discussions where I defend my ideas verbally (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Fast-paced lectures with multiple assessments throughout the term (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: Independent study with minimal lectures and self-directed learning (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Traditional exams and high-volume memorization (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 2, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU is famous for oral exams in Philosophy and Theology. DLSU's trimestral system creates fast-paced assessment cycles. UP emphasizes independent learning with minimal guidance. UST focuses on traditional, volume-heavy pedagogy for board exam preparation.

Question 4: How do you feel about mandatory attendance and strict academic structure?
Choice: I appreciate clear expectations and structured schedules (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 5)
Choice: I prefer flexibility to manage my own time (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: I can adapt to either but prefer some structure (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and UST enforce strict attendance and structured schedules (UST's 7am-7pm blocks are mandatory). UP values independence with minimal attendance requirements. DLSU balances structure with trimestral efficiency.

Question 6: How comfortable are you with a socially elite or wealthy student environment?
Choice: Very comfortable - I come from or relate to that background (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: Uncomfortable - I prefer a more grounded, diverse environment (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Neutral - I can adapt to different social classes (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and DLSU have strong "conyo elite" cultures despite scholarship programs. UST is described as most "grounded" and middle-class. UP struggles with "burgis invasion" but retains diverse social environment. Scholars at ADMU/DLSU report feeling alienated.

Question 7: The idea of joining organizations through rigorous, sometimes intense application processes:
Choice: Excites me - I value exclusivity and proving myself (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: Intimidates me - I prefer easier, more welcoming entry (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Choice: Doesn't matter much - I may not join organizations (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP has the most intense "apps" processes (psychological pressure, hazing-like elements reported). UST and DLSU also have competitive org applications. ADMU's org culture is professional but less brutal. Students avoiding intense org culture should avoid UP.

Question 8: How likely are you to participate in protests or campus activism?
Choice: Very likely - I want to be actively involved in social issues (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Somewhat likely - I support causes but prefer moderate involvement (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Unlikely - I prefer to focus on academics and personal goals (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP is the center of militant activism ("Tibak culture"). ADMU has moderate liberal activism ("radical moderates"). DLSU is pragmatic/centrist. UST activism is suppressed by conservative administration (OSA censorship documented).

Question 10: When you need to enlist in classes, you prefer:
Choice: An organized system even if competitive (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 0, UST: 3)
Choice: First-come-first-served with some luck involved (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Choice: Fixed block schedules decided for me (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: I can handle a chaotic, frustrating system if needed (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU has the most organized enrollment. DLSU's AnimoSys crashes frequently but is functional. UP's CRS is described as "Hunger Games" requiring "prerog" (begging). UST uses pre-determined block sections. UP's system is famously dysfunctional.

Question 11: How important is campus aesthetic and physical beauty to you?
Choice: Very important - I want a beautiful, green sanctuary (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Somewhat important but functionality matters more (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Not important - I focus on academics (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and UST have the most beautiful, tree-filled campuses serving as "sanctuaries." UP's campus is loved for nature despite crumbling facilities. DLSU is vertical/urban with focus on modern facilities over aesthetic beauty.

Question 12: How do you feel about paying premium tuition fees?
Choice: Worth it if facilities and support services are excellent (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 0, UST: 3)
Choice: Acceptable if it's for quality education (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 0, UST: 4)
Choice: Prefer affordable or free education (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP offers free undergraduate tuition. DLSU is most expensive (₱90k+/term). ADMU is expensive with consistent increases. UST is most affordable among private Big 4. Students at ADMU/DLSU expect value for money.

Question 13: Your preferred pace of academic life:
Choice: Fast-paced with three terms per year, minimal breaks (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: Moderate semester pace with traditional breaks (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Flexible, self-directed pace (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU's trimestral system is uniquely fast-paced ("14 weeks of hell"). ADMU and UST use traditional semesters. UP's pace is self-directed but delays are normalized. The trimester creates constant urgency DLSU students describe as relentless.

Question 15: Your ideal food/dining situation on campus:
Choice: Diverse, affordable street food and cheap options (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: Mix of budget and premium options (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Modern cafes and trendy restaurants (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST and UP have the best budget food culture (Dapitan, Area 2). ADMU's food is expensive (₱150-300) with some budget options requiring treks. DLSU has good food courts but higher prices. The University Belt offers unmatched affordability.

Question 16: How do you handle being part of a large, anonymous student population?
Choice: I thrive - I like independence and anonymity (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: I prefer smaller, tighter-knit communities (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: Size doesn't matter as long as I find my group (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP is largest with most anonymity. UST is large but block system creates tight bonds. ADMU is smallest with more personalized attention. DLSU balances size with efficiency. UP's scale can feel isolating without org support.

Question 17: The thought of graduating "on time" vs potentially being delayed:
Choice: Graduating on time is essential to me (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: I'm okay with delays if it means better learning (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Choice: Delays would cause significant stress (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: UP normalizes delays due to CRS and academic difficulty (being "delayed" is destigmatized). DLSU's trimester structure allows for catch-up. UST has debarment risks but summer terms help. ADMU has good retention support. UP students view delays as badges of survival.

Question 18: How important is religious/spiritual life in your university experience?
Choice: Very important - I want religious community and formation (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: Not important - I prefer secular environment (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: Open to exposure but not mandatory participation (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST is most Catholic (mandatory theology, Mass, Angelus). ADMU's Jesuit approach is more "critical" and intellectual. DLSU has Brothers but less religious intensity. UP is uniquely secular with no religious requirements. Non-religious students struggle most at UST.

Question 19: Your approach to networking and building professional connections:
Choice: I actively seek networking opportunities and corporate training (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: I prefer authentic connections over transactional networking (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Choice: Networking isn't a priority for me (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU and ADMU orgs function as corporate training grounds with strong alumni networks. ADMU's SOM particularly emphasizes networking. UP's org culture is service-oriented rather than professional. UST balances both approaches.

Question 23: How important is LGBTQ+ inclusivity and safety to you?
Choice: Extremely important - I need explicit support and safe spaces (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Important but I can navigate less progressive spaces (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: Not a major factor in my decision (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: UP and ADMU are most LGBTQ+ friendly (UP has absolute freedom, ADMU has Gender Hubs and Pride March). UST administration is least supportive (bans cross-dressing, but student body is accepting). DLSU is moderately progressive. UST policies are actively discriminatory despite gay-friendly students.

Question 25: How do you feel about regular weeknight drinking culture?
Choice: That's exactly the social life I want (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Occasional participation is fine (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: Not my scene - I prefer other activities (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU is famous for "Happy Thursday" drinking culture (despite admin crackdowns). ADMU has drinking scenes but less systematic. UP has activist-centered socializing. UST has party culture but less institutionalized than DLSU's Thursday tradition.

Question 26: When professors "don't teach" and expect independent learning, you:
Choice: Thrive - I'm a self-directed learner (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Struggle - I need clear instruction (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Choice: Can adapt but prefer some guidance (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UP explicitly does not "spoon-feed" - professors facilitate rather than teach. ADMU provides structured guidance. DLSU offers clear, efficient instruction. UST has traditional lecture-based teaching. Students who need structure should avoid UP.

Question 27: Your approach to "performative" vs "grassroots" activism:
Choice: I prefer intellectual discourse and institutional advocacy (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: I want to be on the frontlines of protest movements (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: I support causes but don't actively participate (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU activism is critiqued as "performative" (Twitter threads, campus rallies). UP has genuine grassroots militant activism. DLSU is pragmatic and issue-based (tuition protests). UST activism is suppressed. UP students face real risks (red-tagging).

Question 30: How do you want your university to challenge you?
Choice: Through intellectual rigor and critical thinking (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Through volume and endurance testing (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Choice: Through speed and time management demands (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Choice: Through comprehensive support that pushes me to grow (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU and UP emphasize critical thinking (Core Curriculum vs independent analysis). UST focuses on volume and memorization. DLSU demands efficient time management due to trimester pace. ADMU provides supportive challenge; UP and UST test survival abilities.

Question 2: What is your ideal weekly class schedule?
Choice: A packed, predictable block schedule from 7 AM to 7 PM, shared with the same classmates (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 0, UP: 0, UST: 5)
Choice: A fast-paced, variable schedule with classes 4-5 days a week, requiring elite time management (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Choice: A schedule with large gaps for independent study, org work, or activism, but often secured through a stressful lottery system (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 0)
Choice: A structured, balanced schedule with time built in for consultations and reflection (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 0, UST: 2)
Scoring Rationale: UST's block section "7-to-7" is a defining trait. DLSU's trimestral system creates a "sprint." UP's CRS system leads to unpredictable, self-managed schedules. ADMU offers more structure and balance, supporting its *cura personalis* model.

Question 5: What is your preferred style of social interaction and humor?
Choice: "Conyo" banter, discussions about niche interests, and humor that's often Western-influenced (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: "Chill" and inclusive talk, mixing conyo with "kanal" (street) humor depending on the crowd (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 2, UST: 4)
Choice: "Kanal," relatable, grounded humor where being "street-smart" is valued over pretense (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Intense, ideology-infused debate, where social conversations often turn political or philosophical (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU has a noted "conyo" hegemony. DLSU is described as more inclusive but still conyo-dominant. UST prides itself on "kanal" relatability. UP's social discourse is heavily politicized and critical.

Question 7: You're choosing where to eat lunch on a regular day. What's your budget and priority?
Choice: ₱60-₱100: I seek out the hidden, budget-friendly canteens, even if it's a trek (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: ₱120-₱200: I go to the reliable, central student food court for convenience and socializing (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: ₱250+: I enjoy eating at trendy cafes or restaurants near campus as a regular social activity (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 1)
Choice: Cost varies: I prioritize bringing food or cooking to save money, relying on campus pantries (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: UP and UST have strong, affordable food cultures (Area 2, Dapitan). ADMU and DLSU have central food courts (JSEC, Agno) but also high-cost surrounding areas (Regis, Taft). UP's dorm culture often involves strict budgets. The high-cost choice fits ADMU's Katipunan and DLSU's Taft gentrification.

Question 8: What role should student organizations (orgs) play in your college life?
Choice: A professional training ground: highly structured, great for the resume, and a simulation of corporate life (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 2)
Choice: A politicized community: a platform for service and advocacy, expected to take stands on national issues (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: A strict, family-like brotherhood/sisterhood: hard to get into, but provides lifelong bonds and academic survival support (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: A vibrant but bureaucratically stifled space: fun to join, but creativity is limited by admin red tape (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 2, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU orgs are corporate simulations. UP orgs are highly politicized and have intense "apps" processes creating loyalty. UST orgs are vibrant but heavily regulated by the OSA. ADMU orgs are also professional but with a slightly less corporate ethos than DLSU.

Question 13: You come from a provincial public school or a lower-income background. How important is it to find a community of similar students?
Choice: Crucial: I need a sanctuary or formal support group to navigate potential culture shock (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: Important, but I'm confident I can "code-switch" and adapt to the dominant campus culture (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 4)
Choice: Somewhat important, but the campus is diverse enough that I'll find my people regardless (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: Not a priority; I expect to be judged solely on my merit and resilience (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 2, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU has *Ateneo Gabay* for scholars. DLSU scholars report an inclusive vibe but still need to adapt. UP is the most socioeconomically diverse (despite gentrification). UST's "trauma bonding" and middle-class melt pot can integrate students through shared struggle.

Question 15: What is your stance on university rankings and "prestige"?
Choice: It's a primary factor; I want the social capital and network of a top-tier, elite institution (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: It's important, but I value the specific strength and reputation of my chosen program more (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 5, UST: 5)
Choice: I'm skeptical of prestige; I care more about the university's public service mission and intellectual freedom (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: I don't care much for external rankings; surviving the university's own rigorous system is prestige enough (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: All are "Big 4," but ADMU's elite reputation is pronounced. All have program-specific strengths (e.g., UST's board exams). UP's "Iskolar ng Bayan" identity challenges elite prestige. UST's internal "de-barment" culture creates its own metric of prestige through survival.

Question 16: Imagine a professor gives an unfair grade. What is your most likely course of action?
Choice: Formally request a grade consultation, armed with calculations and evidence, as per university policy (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 2)
Choice: Accept it as part of the "terror prof" experience, vent on anonymous freedom walls, and move on (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Discuss it with classmates, organize collective feedback, or escalate it as an issue of academic justice (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: Seek advice from a guidance counselor or student support service on how to handle it (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 1, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU has a formalized Grade Consultation Day culture. UST's normalization of "terror profs" leads to resigned venting. UP's collective, activist spirit can turn issues into campaigns. ADMU's support structures (*cura personalis*) are a key feature.

Question 20: How important is a vibrant, large-scale campus tradition (like a Christmas fair or a concert series) to you?
Choice: Very Important; it's the emotional payoff and highlight of the school year (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Important, but I'm critical if it becomes too commercialized or loses its original spirit (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: Somewhat Important; it's a fun excuse to party and socialize (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Choice: Not Important; I prefer smaller, organic gatherings or don't prioritize school-sponsored events (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 1)
Scoring Rationale: UST's Paskuhan is the definitive, can't-miss tradition. UP Fair is major but constantly critiqued for commercialization. DLSU's "Happy Thursday" legacy points to a social party culture. Some UP students are cynical about large events.

Question 22: How do you feel about English being the dominant language of instruction and social interaction on campus?
Choice: I prefer it; it's the language of global opportunity and academic discourse (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 3)
Choice: I'm comfortable with it, but I appreciate a campus where code-switching to Filipino is common and natural (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: I'm critical of it; it can be an exclusionary barrier and undermines our national language (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 3)
Choice: It doesn't matter to me; I'll adapt to whatever linguistic code helps me fit in and succeed (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: ADMU has a strong "conyo" English hegemony. DLSU and UP show more fluid code-switching. UP has active discourse about language and elitism. UST students pride themselves on being "social chameleons" who adapt.

Question 23: What is your biggest concern regarding campus safety?
Choice: Theft or snatching in open, public areas within or immediately around campus (ADMU: 3, DLSU: 5, UP: 5, UST: 4)
Choice: Harassment (sexual or otherwise) from within the university community (peers, professors) (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 3, UP: 4, UST: 3)
Choice: Overly repressive security or administration that polices student behavior and expression (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 1, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Navigating natural elements like flooding or extreme heat during commutes (ADMU: 1, DLSU: 2, UP: 3, UST: 5)
Scoring Rationale: DLSU's Taft and UP's open campus have notable theft issues. ADMU had the "Time's Up" movement addressing internal harassment. UST's OSA is the epitome of repressive security. UST's "Waterworld" flooding is a legendary safety/annoyance concern.


Question 26: What is your financial priority when considering university?
Choice: Minimizing cost: Tuition must be free or very low, even if it means facing resource scarcity (ADMU: 0, DLSU: 0, UP: 5, UST: 1)
Choice: Maximizing value: I'm willing to pay high tuition for top-notch facilities, support, and career ROI (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 1, UST: 3)
Choice: Seeking balance: I'll rely on scholarships and budget living, accepting some financial stress for the education (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 5, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: Cost is secondary: I will find a way to afford the university that fits me best, regardless of price (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 4, UP: 2, UST: 3)
Scoring Rationale: UP has free tuition. ADMU and DLSU have the highest tuition but offer scholarships (~20% of population) and premium facilities. All four have scholars who navigate financial stress, but it's a defining feature of the private schools.

Question 30: Ultimately, what kind of personal transformation are you seeking from university?
Choice: To become an articulate, well-rounded leader with a strong moral compass for service (ADMU: 5, DLSU: 3, UP: 2, UST: 4)
Choice: To become a resilient, street-smart survivor with hardened work ethic and practical skills (ADMU: 2, DLSU: 4, UP: 4, UST: 5)
Choice: To become a critical, independent thinker unafraid to challenge systems and authority (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 2, UP: 5, UST: 2)
Choice: To become a competent, efficient professional ready to excel in the corporate world (ADMU: 4, DLSU: 5, UP: 3, UST: 4)
Scoring Rationale: This summarizes archetypes from the research: ADMU's "Philosopher-King," UST's "Resilient Soldier," UP's "Activist-Intellectual," and DLSU's "Corporate Tycoon/Achiever." Each university's culture primes students for a distinct type of personal and professional formation.
