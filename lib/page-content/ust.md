### **University of Santo Tomas (UST): A Journey Through the Tiger’s Den**

The University of Santo Tomas (UST) is a private, Catholic research university in Manila, founded in 1611, making it the oldest university in Asia. Managed by the Order of Preachers (Dominicans), it is located in the heart of the University Belt. UST is widely recognized for its consistent excellence in health sciences, architecture, and accountancy, maintaining a strong reputation for producing topnotchers in national licensure exams.

### **A. Academic Life: The High-Volume Survival Marathon**

If you choose UST, prepare yourself for a high-volume, high-pressure system. The academic culture here is less about "finding yourself" and more about a "survival of the fittest" mentality. One of the biggest shocks you will face is the **block section system**. Unlike other universities where you can curate your own schedule, your classes at UST are often rigid. In colleges like Pharmacy (FOP) or Science, "7-to-7" schedules—7:00 AM to 7:00 PM—are a daily reality, sometimes extending even later for Engineering students.

The workload focuses heavily on quantity and endurance. You will likely encounter the "terror professor" archetype: faculty members who use intimidation, arbitrary grading, or massive workloads as pedagogical tools. While the university produces technically competent graduates, it often does so through a "sink or swim" model.

> "The workload in UST is like being squeezed like a rag until nothing is left. You will be humbled by the 30-unit semesters and zero-based grading."

Different colleges have their own unique "flavors" of stress:

* **AMV College of Accountancy:** Known as the "Hunger Games" because of its strict debarment policy and qualifying exams that reshuffle or eliminate blocks of students.


* **Faculty of Engineering:** Often joked about as the "Summer Capital of UST" because so many students fail major subjects and must retake them during the summer term.


* **College of Architecture:** A place where all-nighters are romanticized and expected, earning it the title of "the college that never sleeps".

### **B. Campus & Daily Life: The Golden Cage and Waterworld**

The physical campus of UST is a dual experience: it is both a beautiful sanctuary and a legendary flood zone. The grounds are universally adored by students. Walking under the centuries-old trees or seeing the Main Building lit up at night provides a "dopamine hit" that helps mitigate the stress of the heavy workload.

However, "flood culture" is a genuine part of the Thomasian identity. Navigating waist-deep water on España Boulevard or being stranded inside the campus during a typhoon is a "badge of honor". While drainage has improved, you will still find yourself playing the "suspension game," waiting for late-night announcements from an administration often criticized for disregarding commuter safety.

Safety is a mixed bag. While the interior is safe, the perimeter along España and P. Noval is notorious for snatchers and hold-uppers. You will need to stay vigilant the moment you step outside the gates.

### **C. Social & Cultural Fit: The Social Chameleon**

UST students pride themselves on being "social chameleons". Unlike the perceived elitism of Ateneo or La Salle, UST is a melting pot. You will find students from wealthy families mixing effortlessly with scholars and those from the middle class.

The social vibe is generally more grounded and "down-to-earth". The mandatory uniform, while often hated for its restriction, acts as a "great equalizer" that hides class distinctions.

> "We are 'social chameleons.' We can be 'conyo' when we need to, but we are most at home being 'kanal' (street-smart). We don't have the intellectual snobbery of other schools; we just want to pass our exams and eat Angkong."

Dating is also a major part of the atmosphere. There is a persistent campus meme that "Thomasians are all taken," leading to a bustling scene at "Lovers' Lane" near the Main Building. If you are single, you might feel like you are third-wheeling the entire university.

### **D. Identity & Values: Tradition vs. Repression**

Being a Thomasian means navigating a deeply Catholic environment. You will take mandatory Theology classes and hear the Angelus bell daily. If you are not Catholic, you will generally be respected by peers, but you must still follow institutional rituals like retreats and mass.

The biggest cultural friction at UST is between a modernizing student body and a conservative administration. The **Office for Student Affairs (OSA)** is frequently villainized for repressive policies. This came to a head in 2024 with the **TomasinoWeb 7-Eleven incident**, where a student media organization was forced to take down a photo because students in uniform supposedly "resembled 7-Eleven employees". This incident highlighted an administration often perceived as more obsessed with its pristine image than with student freedom of expression.

### **E. Organizations & Career: Professionalism and "Palakasan"**

Joining a top-tier student organization like the *Varsitarian* or the Central Student Council is described as a "bloodbath". The application processes are rigorous, often mimicking corporate interviews. However, there are frequent complaints about "Palakasan" (nepotism), where leadership roles allegedly go to those with the right connections.

Despite the internal politics, being a UST graduate carries significant weight in the professional world. Employers often view Thomasians as "resilient" and "trainable" because the university environment forces you to navigate heavy workloads and bureaucratic rigidity.

### **F. Practical Realities: The Frugal Gourmet**

UST’s food culture is arguably the best and most affordable among the "Big 4".

* **Dapitan Side:** The place for budget-friendly "lutong bahay" and the legendary **Angkong** dimsum.


* P. Noval Side: Home to trendier, more social spots.
You can easily survive on a budget of 100 pesos per meal.



The cost of living in Sampaloc is lower than in Katipunan or Taft, making it more accessible. However, the trade-off is the infrastructure; while the campus is a "sanctuary," the surrounding area is dense, chaotic, and prone to crime.

### **Student Perspective Sections**

#### **🚩 Red Flags (Real Talk)**

* **Administrative Repression:** The OSA is known for censorship and strict control over student organizations and media.


* **Mental Health Insensitivity:** Students report that mental health services are understaffed and that administrative processes for psychiatric clearances can feel like a liability check rather than actual care.


* **Academic Attrition:** The "debarment" culture in Accountancy and the high failure rates in Engineering create a constant state of anxiety.


* **Archaic Rules:** Strict dress codes, hair color bans, and uniform regulations can feel like an extension of high school.



#### **💚 Green Flags (What Students Love)**

* **Paskuhan:** The annual Christmas celebration is the "emotional payoff" for all the semester's suffering, featuring fireworks and concerts that foster intense school pride.


* **Grounded Community:** The lack of social pretension makes it easy to find friends who are relatable and down-to-earth.


* **Affordable Food:** You will never go hungry with the variety of cheap, iconic eats surrounding the campus.


* **Technical Competence:** The rigorous focus on licensure exams means you will likely leave with high technical skills and employability.



#### **🔑 Survival Tips (From Students Who Made It)**

* **Bond With Your Block:** Since you spend 12 hours a day with the same people, your blockmates are your survival net. Don't try to go it alone.


* **Master the Weather App:** During monsoon season, obsessively check for floods on España. Know when to stay home and when to bring a change of clothes.


* **Eat at Angkong Early:** The lines for the student-favorite dimsum get long. Strategic lunch timing is a skill.


* **Develop a "Thick Skin":** You will face "terror profs" and bureaucratic hurdles. Learning to handle criticism and setbacks without crumbling is the unofficial 4th "C" of UST.



#### **💭 What Kind of Student Thrives Here?**

You will thrive at UST if you are **resilient, socially adaptable, and value community over individual autonomy.** It is the place for students who are okay with a traditional, high-volume academic structure and who find strength in "trauma bonding" with their peers. If you enjoy a homey, grounded atmosphere and don't mind following strict rules in exchange for a high-quality technical education, you will love the Tiger’s Den.

You might struggle if you are fiercely independent, desire a liberal or radical political environment, or cannot handle high-pressure exam cultures. Students who want a "chill" college experience or who find religious/administrative structure stifling often feel "wrecked" by the system.
