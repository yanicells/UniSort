i want you to create a prompt. basically to help you understand the codebase right now. because my code right now is just functionality first. no design whatsoever, so it looks very shit. and lots of things are not yet implemented. basically i know you know most of what is happening but there are details that are not there yet. basically create a prompt so that you are able to be up to speed. so that, we can brainstorm what needs to be done, what UI changes we should make, basically transform this workin version into one that looks nice and ready for production.
here is copilot-instructions.md this is generated by copilot. i want you to give me a prompt for the remaining information that we need. because i want to be able to analyze each part page by page so that we can drastically improve the UI. what we will do is basically, once you give me the prompt, you will have enough information about the code and how the project is right now, and then we will go through the main parts, ask me for my opinion on the UI changes, and we will create another prompt to do the UI.

dump:
have separate chats for each university
tell it to look mainly for ff categories (find in old chat)
make it more personality and like preferences even dating, culture, etc.
tell it to find on freedomwall, fb post, twitter post, reddit post those that are more unfiltered and raw

compile those they have researched and let new ai make the quiz

quiz
not necessarily 4 3 2 1
not necessarily like each uni has their own take
we can assign questions to be like on a scale?
not necessarily like which one are you gonna do or which one do u like most
it can be like
like for example if the question is participating in orgs its like kind of likely, no, sure, ofc something like that and we decide points which uni suits that
