Title: What actually makes Ateneo different from the other Big 4?

What genuinely sets Ateneo apart from UP/DLSU/UST in your experience? What kind of student thrives there vs. who struggles? What's the day-to-day vibe like – the orgs, social life, academics, campus culture?

Any "only in Ateneo" moments or things that surprised you would be super helpful too.

Looking for honest, nuanced takes. I'm working on a personality quiz that matches people to one of the Big 4 unis, and I want it to feel real and personal. Thanks!

i want you to create a prompt. basically to help you understand the codebase right now. because my code right now is just functionality first. no design whatsoever, so it looks very shit. and lots of things are not yet implemented. basically i know you know most of what is happening but there are details that are not there yet. basically create a prompt so that you are able to be up to speed. so that, we can brainstorm what needs to be done, what UI changes we should make, basically transform this workin version into one that looks nice and ready for production.
