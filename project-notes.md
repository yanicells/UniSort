Title: What actually makes Ateneo different from the other Big 4?

What genuinely sets Ateneo apart from UP/DLSU/UST in your experience? What kind of student thrives there vs. who struggles? What's the day-to-day vibe like – the orgs, social life, academics, campus culture?

Any "only in Ateneo" moments or things that surprised you would be super helpful too.

Looking for honest, nuanced takes. I'm working on a personality quiz that matches people to one of the Big 4 unis, and I want it to feel real and personal. Thanks!
